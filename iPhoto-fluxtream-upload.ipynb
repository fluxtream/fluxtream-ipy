      "\n",
      "<p>Install instructions for iPython Notebook are <a href=\"http://ipython.org/install.html\">here</a>.  At least on osx systems, after installation you can start the server by going to Terminal and calling 'ipython notebook'.   This will start a local web server talking to an iPython kernel and open a [root IP[y] page](http://127.0.0.1:8890/tree).  \n",

      "<h2> Timestamps and timezones</H2>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It's necessary to calculate the absolute time of a photo to have it combine properly with other data.  The Fluxtream photo upload API uses epoch timestamps, aka unix time, which is the number of seconds since midnight 1/1/1970 in UTC (aka GMT). Converting local time to epoch time requires knowing what timezone to use for interpreting the local time.  A good web site that helps convert date/time stamps back and forth between local time + timezone and epoch time is http://www.epochconverter.com/.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Sadly, EXIF timestamps in photos historically only recorded local time without timezone information.  This dates back to the days when cameras were stand-alone devices that uniformly didn't have a concept of timezone.  It was up to the individual human using the camera to set the clock, and remember to change it (or not) for travel and daylight savings time.  Converting these timestamps to epoch time requires an additional source of information for deciding which timezone to use.  \n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Some newer devices, such as iPhones, do have a model for what timezone they are in at any given point in time.  However, they (or at least their firmware or photo capture apps) are not consistent about how or if they record the timezone they used to generate a given local timestamp in the EXIF.  These inconsistentcies happen between different devices, different versions of the same device, firmware, or app, and different environmental conditions for a given device/firmware/app instance.  \n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Even worse, some methods of transferring photos that *did*, at some point, contain valid timezone information strip that info off and throw it away.  For example, while a photo is in the camera roll on an iOS device it has a beautiful, high precision, unambigous ephoch timestamp.  All the existing methods I can find for transferring photos from iOS devices lose those high precsion timestamps.  Many of the transfer methods also strip off info that could be used to recover the timezone.  Both Flickr and Picasa suffer from these problems.  Their APIs only report local time without time zone.  Various forums online document problems people have with various combinations of devices, apps, uploaders, etc. corrupting the photo timestamps.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A while back, we added photo upload capability to the <a href=\"https://github.com/fluxtream/fluxtream-capture-ios\">FluxtreamCapture iOS app</a> to try to make a sustainable method for people with iOS devices to stream photos to Fluxtream with the timestamps properly preserved.  Unfortunately there are still hurdles we haven't gotten over that block us from making it available on the app store, not everyone has the resources to build an iOS app from sources, and even with TestFlight the difficulty of dealing with Apple provisioning limits its impact.  However, even if the FluxtreamCapture iOS app availability issues weren't a problem, that still doesn't help with photos captured by other methods, and for those sitting around in people's filesystems.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>There's really no universally correct solution to this problem of timezone ambiguity of existing photos.  However, a given individual facing a given directory of photos they took at some point in the past can potentially do the detective work to set reasonable defaults for particuar ranges of photos.  For example, I have old directories of photos taken during particular trips and remember, or can dig up, enough context to know what timezone they were taken in.  I know that christmas pictures are from CST (Texas in December), the honeymoon pictures are from PDT (Hawaii in April, but we decided to keep to PDT on that trip so we could sleep late and still see the sun rise), and when it was that I moved from Central to Eastern to Pacific and back to Eastern time zones.  I also know my own aesthetics for the tradeoff between tedious perfection and broad, generally correct brush strokes.  \n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The problem is how to combine this personal contextual debugging capability and aesthetics with particular batches of images I'd like to upload. It would be great to have an app with a great user experience that let me set unambiguous timezone info on my directories full of photos.  However, if it exists I haven't seen it, and I certainly am not up to creating such a thing.  The best solution I can come up with is to leverage the API FluxtreamCapture uses to upload photos with absolute timestamps, provide this iPython notebook, implement and describe a default strategy, and let you modify the behavior if the default is not what you want.  \n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The function <code>upload_photo_range(start_photo, end_photo)</code> can upload a range of consecutive photos in increasing alphanumeric order from within a given directory.  It takes as arguments absolute paths to the first and last photos, and requires that the directories match.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For each photo, it calls the function <code>image_creation_time(filename)</code>.  If a given photo includes unambigous timezone information that the function knows how to recognize, it will use that timezone and store that timezone in <code>last_tz</code> to use as the default for the next ambigous one.  If it doesn't recognize an unambiguous timezone for a given photo, it will use <code>last_tz</code> if it is set.  Otherwise it will default to <code>default_tz</code>, which you set manually.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The only EXIF tag that the <code>image_creation_time</code> function currently recognizes to disambiguate the timezone is 'GPS GPSTimeStamp' field, which is the one used by iOS for photos taken while the GPS is on.  The iOS photos that I've processed so far which lack this tag are the ones I took in Airplane Mode.  Those photos have no GPS EXIF tags, and I can't find any other tags on those photos to disambiguate the timezone.  However, if, like me, you don't modify the timezone manually in flight and wait until you land and get the timezone from the cell tower, the <code>last_tz</code> heuristic should work pretty well.  If you have photos from another source that uses other tags that could disambiguate the timezone, please modify the <code>image_creation_time</code> function and send the upgrade and, ideally, a sample image to <a href=\"mailto:info@fluxtream.org\">info@fluxtream.org</a>.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To test what would happen for a particular range of images without uploading, you can execute the cell that starts \"Optionally use this block to disable upload\", then execute the path setting and upload block.  Once you're happy with what would happen, you can execute the cell that starts \"Optionally use this block to re-enable upload\", then execute the path setting and upload block and it will perform the upload. If you do neither, then by default it will upload and be less verbose about timezones.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What I'm doing is skimming each directory of images I want to upload and deciding if they're probably from one timezone or not.  In the former case, I set <code>default_tz</code> appropriately, set <code>last_tz=None</code>, set start_photo and end_photo to the first and last photos in the directory, and let it go.  In the latter case, I'd execute the \"Optionally use this block to disable upload\" cell, see if I agree where the timezone transitions happen (I mostly record travel that would cross timezones in my Google Calendar), and potentially break up the directory into multiple sets of start_photo and end_photo with appropriate <code>default_tz</code> values to make the right thing happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Note that as you process each block, if you want you can make multiple copies of the commands in the path setting and upload block, strip out the comments to make it more compact, annotate why you chose the timezone in each block, and leave the cells around for documentation and repeatability.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Note that uploading a photo multiple times with identical time values will safely ignore subsequent uploads.  However, if you upload the same image multiple times with different timezones you will end up with duplicates.  There is no API or user interaction component in Fluxtream that allows the deletion of a previously-uploaded image.  If you upload images and later regret it, please send the info about your situation, including your Fluxtream username, guest ID, and the details of what range of photos you want deleted to <a href=\"mailto:info@fluxtream.org\">info@fluxtream.org</a>.  You can get your Guest ID by doing the step below to set up your Fluxtream credentials and looking at the value of <code>fluxtream_guest_id</code>.  It's not obvious to me what the right move would be for adding API support for deletion.  In the case of an oops, input about what you wish the API supported, and how you feel about how to handle the other possible oops of accidental deletion, would be appreciated.\n"
