=============

Repository of iPython notebooks which interface to Fluxtream.

If you are new to iPython notebooks, [here](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) is the main IP[y] website. 

You will need to install python and iPython notebook on your local system, run a local ipython kernel, and import a local copy of one or more of these notebook to be able to execute and modify the code.

Install instructions are [here](http://ipython.org/install.html). At least on osx systems, you can start the server by going to Terminal and calling 'ipython notebook'. This will start a local web server and open a an IP[y] page talking to it in a web browser. 

Within the IP[y] startup page, you can open an iPython notebook saved locally by clicking on the link near the top that says "To import a notebook, drag the file onto the listing below or click here."

Once you have IP[y] generally working on your system, here's a brief intro in how to use it:
* A green outline shows the currently selected cell.
* Select a different cell by clicking on it.
* Execute the currently selected cell by either clicking the play button on the icon bar at the top, selecting Cell/Run from the menu bar, or by using the keyboard shortcut Shift-Return.
