      "<p>This iPython notebook walks you through reading data from a Netatmo account, either via CSV files downloaded from the Netatmo web site or via use of the Netatmo API, and sending it to Fluxtream.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If you are new to iPython notebooks, <a href=\"http://ipython.org/notebook.html\">here</a> is the main IP[y] website.  You will need to install python and iPython notebook on your local system, run a local ipython kernel, and install a local copy of this notebook to be able to execute and modify the code below.  Install instructions are <a href=\"http://ipython.org/install.html\">here</a>.  On osx systems, you can start the server by going to Terminal and calling 'ipython notebook'.  This will start a local web server and open a an IP[y] page talking to it in a web browser.  Within the IP[y] page, you can open a saved iPython notebooy by going to File/Open.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Once you have IP[y] generally working on your system, here's a brief intro in how to use it: \n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>A green outline shows the currently selected cell.  \n",
      "<li>Select a different cell by clicking on it, or by using escape to enter command mode (grey outline) and use the keyboard shortcuts listed under the Help menu.  \n",
      "<li>Execute the currently selected cell by either clicking the play button on the icon bar at the top, selecting Cell/Run from the menu bar, or by using the keyboard shortcut Shift-Return.  \n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When a given cell is executed, it may print output which appears below the cell, and the cursor will continue to the next cell.  If the next cell is tall, you might need to scroll back up to see the previous cell's output.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p> Each cell in this notebook pertains to a particular step in the process, topic, or action requiring your input and contains comments at the top saying what it's about and what you should do. \n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Cells that require entry of sensitive information, such as passwords, start with a phrase like \"<b>Execute and fill in the fields below</b>\".  These generally create entry forms in the output area below the cell that you need to fill in.  Generally, the cell will clear the sensitive input boxes after clicking the button.  It may also print out suggestions about how you could set up a new cell for future use if you're confident other's won't see your copy of the notebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Cells that require customization for your own setup start with \"<b>Modify</b>\".  These include cells where you configure which Netatmo stations and modules you want to upload, what Fluxtream device names you want to associate with each one with, or where you've saved CSV files on your system.  These require some thought about which sets of data you want to see in Fluxtream and how you want it to appear.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Cells that define functions or do other things that don't require user input or modification generally just start with \"<b>Execute</b>\".  These can just be executed without much consideration, though you may want to go back later to understand or modify them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "<p>This notebook also includes examples of doing custom processing on the data before sending it to Fluxtream.  The functions below which process the Netatmo data read the raw Temperature and Humidity values and calculate a derived metric called H2O_ppm which gives the parts per million of water in the air.  They also convert the temperature to Farenheit.  Those of you from cultures which foster an intuitive feel for celcius can change this behavior by removing the calls to <code>C2F()</code> in <code>netatmo_csv_to_post_data</code> and/or <code>netatmo_api_to_post_data</code>.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Please enjoy, tinker, modify, etc.  Feel free to contact <a href=\"mailto:info@fluxtream.org\">info@fluxtream.org</a> if you have questions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Note that uploading data multiple times to a given device and channel with identical time values each time will safely overwrite the previous values.  However, there is no API or user interaction component in Fluxtream that allows the deletion of a previously-uploaded device or channel, and you can't delete data points already uploaded to a given channel.  If you create device names or channel names, or upload data at incorrect timepoints within a given channel, and later regret it, please send the info about your situation, including your Fluxtream username, guest ID, and the details of which devices and or channels you want deleted to <a href=\"mailto:info@fluxtream.org\">info@fluxtream.org</a>.  You can get your Guest ID by doing the step below to set up your Fluxtream credentials and looking at the value of <code>fluxtream_guest_id</code>.  Also note that the Fluxtream upload API cannot currently handle empty cells within the data array used in an upload call.  I'm hoping to fix this in the future."
