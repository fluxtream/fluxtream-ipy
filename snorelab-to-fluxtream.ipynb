      "<p>Note that uploading data multiple times to a given device and channel with identical time values each time will safely overwrite the previous values.  However, there is no API or user interaction component in Fluxtream that allows the deletion of a previously-uploaded device or channel, and you can't delete data points already uploaded to a given channel.  If you create device names or channel names, or upload data at incorrect timepoints within a given channel, and later regret it, please send the info about your situation, including your Fluxtream username, guest ID, and the details of which devices and or channels you want deleted to <a href=\"mailto:info@fluxtream.org\">info@fluxtream.org</a>.  You can get your Guest ID by doing the step below to set up your Fluxtream credentials and looking at the value of <code>fluxtream_guest_id</code>.  Also note that the Fluxtream upload API cannot currently handle empty cells within the data array used in an upload call.  I'm hoping to fix this in the future."
