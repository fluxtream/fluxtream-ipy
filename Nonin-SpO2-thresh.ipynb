      "<p>This iPython notebook walks you through reading data from a Fluxtream data channel, computing a function on it, and uploading a new computed channel back to Fluxtream.  This particular example reads data from a nonin SpO2 sensor channel and writes back a thresholded channel called SpO2_thresh_X, where X is the value of a given threshold, for data points that are below that threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The real value of this notebook, I hope, is to provide an example of how to read data from a Fluxtream datastore channel, do something to it, and write it back.  If you have a Nonin 3150, you can import and run the <a href=\"http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fluxtream/Nonin-WristOx2-3150/blob/master/Nonin-WristOx2-3150.ipynb\">Nonin-WristOx2-3150 notebook</a> to upload your channels to try this on.  Otherwise, if you email me at <a href=\"mailto:info@fluxtream.org\">info@fluxtream.org</a> I can add you as a buddy to access the Nonin 3150 channels uploaded to the test account (Guest ID=1).  Or you can just modify the channel names and function to do something interesting to your own data channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>If you are new to iPython notebooks, <a href=\"http://ipython.org/notebook.html\">here</a> is the main IP[y] website.  You will need to install python and iPython notebook on your local system, run a local ipython kernel, and install a local copy of this notebook to be able to execute and modify the code below.  Install instructions are <a href=\"http://ipython.org/install.html\">here</a>.  On osx systems, you can start the server by going to Terminal and calling 'ipython notebook'.  This will start a local web server and open a an IP[y] page talking to it in a web browser.  Within the IP[y] page, you can open a saved iPython notebooy by going to File/Open.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Once you have IP[y] generally working on your system, here's a brief intro in how to use it: \n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>A green outline shows the currently selected cell.  \n",
      "<li>Select a different cell by clicking on it, or by using escape to enter command mode (grey outline) and use the keyboard shortcuts listed under the Help menu.  \n",
      "<li>Execute the currently selected cell by either clicking the play button on the icon bar at the top, selecting Cell/Run from the menu bar, or by using the keyboard shortcut Shift-Return.  \n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>When a given cell is executed, it may print output which appears below the cell, and the cursor will continue to the next cell.  If the next cell is tall, you might need to scroll back up to see the previous cell's output.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p> Each cell in this notebook pertains to a particular step in the process, topic, or action requiring your input and contains comments at the top saying what it's about and what you should do. \n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Cells that require entry of sensitive information, such as passwords, start with a phrase like \"<b>Execute and fill in the fields below</b>\".  These generally create entry forms in the output area below the cell that you need to fill in.  Generally, the cell will clear the sensitive input boxes after clicking the button.  It may also print out suggestions about how you could set up a new cell for future use if you're confident other's won't see your copy of the notebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Cells that require customization for your own setup start with \"<b>Modify</b>\".  These include cells where you configure which channels you want to process and what you want to call the resulting data.  These require some thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Cells that define functions or do other things that don't require user input or modification generally just start with \"<b>Execute</b>\".  These can just be executed without much consideration, though you may want to go back later to understand or modify them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Please enjoy, tinker, modify, etc.  Feel free to contact <a href=\"mailto:info@fluxtream.org\">info@fluxtream.org</a> if you have questions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Note that uploading data multiple times to a given device and channel with identical time values each time will safely overwrite the previous values.  However, there is no API or user interaction component in Fluxtream that allows the deletion of a previously-uploaded device or channel, and you can't delete data points already uploaded to a given channel.  If you create device names or channel names, or upload data at incorrect timepoints within a given channel, and later regret it, please send the info about your situation, including your Fluxtream username, guest ID, and the details of which devices and or channels you want deleted to <a href=\"mailto:info@fluxtream.org\">info@fluxtream.org</a>.  You can get your Guest ID by doing the step below to set up your Fluxtream credentials and looking at the value of <code>fluxtream_guest_id</code>.  Also note that the Fluxtream upload API cannot currently handle empty cells within the data array used in an upload call.  I'm hoping to fix this in the future."
